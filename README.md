# Data Analysis of Out of School Children using Python

**Problem Statement :** 
UN Sustainable Development Goals [ link ](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300) are by 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education leading to relevant and effective learning outcomes However... GLOBAL TEACHER SHORTAGE THREATENS EDUCATION 2030: UIS [ link ](http://www.uis.unesco.org/education/pages/world-teachers-day-2015.aspx?spslanguage=en) data show that 33 countries still wonâ€™t have enough teachers to provide every child with a primary education by 2030 if current trends continue.

We performed data analysis of UNESCO data and at first looked at how many 6-12 year old children on this planet are 
out of school now. We go through data exploration and visualization to get the actual scenario. 

**Data Source:** UNESCO Institute for Statistics (http://data.uis.unesco.org/)

**Tools/Platform :** ipython notebook (Python 2.7.10, Anaconda 2.3.0(64 bit) (default, May 28 2015, 16:44:52)

**Data Analysis Steps :**

**Step 1 :** Getting Started with using Python on iPython notebook

**Step 2 :** Getting the data from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics

**Step 3 :** Importing and cleaning the data frame using Pandas

**Step 4:** Aggregating results using group by and pivot_table

**Step 5 :** Exploratory visualizations
